Jane has generated \\\\$337.59 more in sales than Steven, which is about 20%.  All of the employees are Sales Support Agents, so there should be no differences in sales due to titles.  What does contribute to the higher sales for Jane compared to the others is that her hire date was in April of 2017 while Margaret's was May and Steven's was October of 2017.  Because Jane has had more experience and time to help customers generate sales, this could largely be the reason why she has the most sales.  "
