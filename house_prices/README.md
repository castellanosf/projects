# Project Overview

This project aims to predict house sale prices in Ames, Iowa by creating a regression model.  A pipeline of functions to transform features, select features, 
and then train and test the data are created and used multiple times in order to create an optimal model.  Feature engineering and feature selection 
modify our model to lower the root mean squared error.
