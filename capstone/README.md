# Capstone Overview

This capstone project is the culminating research paper for my Masters in Science program for Mathematics at the University of West Florida.  The purpose of the 
paper is to study the relationship between diet and stroke and diabetes in Western, high-income countries.  The study uses a dataset from three years-
1990, 2000, and 2010.  Principal Component Analysis and Multiple Linear Regression with Box-Cox transformation are used to determine which foods or nutrients
had a significant effect on stroke or diabetes rates.

## Data
The data is included as a csv file named '2000_data'.
